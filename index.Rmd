Im Tobias! Im currently an NSF graduate research fellow and PhD student in the department of Entomology at Cornell University co-advised by [Scott McArt](https://blogs.cornell.edu/mcartlab/) and [Bryan Danforth](https://www.danforthlab.entomology.cornell.edu/). Broadly interested in solitary bees, microbial ecology, and pesticide impacts on bee microbiomes.
 
Before this I worked at UC Davis with [Rachel Vannette](https://vannettelab.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) studying microbial communities in floral nectar and with [Jay Rosenheim](https://rosenheim.faculty.ucdavis.edu/) studying community dynamics in cotton and alfalfa systems as well as early season insects pests of California citrus.
